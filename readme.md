This book is a work in progress.

It hasn't gotten a proper proof reading yet.

Much of Go's existing documentation, while excellent, is clearly aimed at developers who live and breath pointers -- not surprising given Go's genesis. My goal is to target this towards developers who aren't as familiar/comfortable with these concepts.

I'm planning 3 more chapters:

Chapter 4 is a bucket chapter to cover code organization (packages), interfaces, error handling and various other little tidbits.

Chapter 5 will deal with concurrency.

Chapter 6 will explore some of Go's more complicated built-in packages (http server, database access and json).

I expect to have the three chapters done by Wednesday Oct 15.
